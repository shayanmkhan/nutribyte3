# NutriByte
This Java desktop application was built using Eclipse and JavaFX. Its primary functionality is as follows:
1. The user creates a recommended nutrient profile based on their age, weight, height, and physical activity. This profile can also be imported from a CSV file.
2. The user searches the USDA database of 239,000+ American food products, and adds products to their daily "diet list."
3. Based on the products in the diet list, an interactive graph shows the comparison between the user's daily nutrient consumption and their recommended nutrient consumption.

The main code files are located in the NutriByte/src folder. The program can be run by downloading the project, loading it into Eclipse, and running the main launch configuration.
